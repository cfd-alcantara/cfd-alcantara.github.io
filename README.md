<h1 align="center">Hi this is my README for the Learning Task 1: Personal Website</h1>

<h3 align="center">Criteria 1: Applications of Concepts Taught</h3>
<p>For this criteria I started with the HTML tags first then created the whole HTML structure before doing any of the designs in the CSS or JS. I used various CSS selectors and one of the most used selector in my code is the class selector. For the animations I just stick with the basic animations like a pulse of the picture. I also added an animation for the hamburger menu and a scrolling animation to make it more appealing</p>

<h3 align="center">Criteria 2 and 4: Design and Creativity</h3> 
<p>For the design it is mostly like the recommended youtube video because I liked it style. I am a person who likes minimal designs and does not go overboard on designs mainly because I just prefer minimal designs. Although it took me a lot of time experimenting on the flexbox because the items are going to weird places and not actually going to the place I want it to be displayed. And I also added a small GIF from a game I liked as a kid</p>

<h3 align="center">Criteria 3: Content</h3>
<p>For the content it is composed of my personal detail such as my name, skills, interests, projects, and achievements. For the projects I used my OBE from my subject from before which is the 4 pics 1 word. And I also added my resume the one I made for my english class.</p>

<h3 align="center">Criteria 5: Deployment</h3>
<p>For the Deployment GitHub deplyed my website using the GitHub pages.</p>

<h3 align="center">Insights that I have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)</h3>
<p>Well for the all of these exercises I learned the basics such as the HTML tags, css selectors, and inline and outline CSS and JS. I also learned that HTML is almost always paired with CSS and JS for the design whether be inline or outline. And that with the right knowledge you can think of this Languages as easy although it can be confusing.</p>

<h3 align="center">Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)</h3>
<p>The struggle is that the first time I learned about HTML, CSS, and JS is in the first class of this course which was somewhat hard because I don't know any of the syntax and tags that is available. Although there are materials given there was still too much information. Now I know the basics of HTML and CSS but I still sometimes forget what code I can use and what is it for.</p>

<h3 align="center">Improvement of My Website</h3>
<p>Since the design of my website is minimal some people might think that it is too bland. So I guess after seeing more personal websites with different designs that are not minimal I can use those as a reference to improve the design of my website in the future. And add some more of my projects into this personal website because the projects I have in the personal website is the 4 pics 1 word and the personal website itself.</p>
